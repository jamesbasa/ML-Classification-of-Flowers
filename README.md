# ML-Classification-of-Flowers
This contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses the famous iris flowers dataset to evaluate different ML classification algorithms in order to predict flower species given 4 different flower measurements.

Created with the help of a tutorial by Jason Brownlee and a dataset by Due and Graff.
